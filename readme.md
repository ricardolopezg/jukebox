You've had a bit of time to get familiar with object oriented JavaScript. Time to use that knowledge to make the coolest juke joint in the place!

Using any mp3 you can find online, create a simple web page where you can play it. After this step, research which JavaScript functions can pause, play, and stop the Jukebox.

Encapsulate all of this functionality in a JavaScript object so that starting a song is as simple as calling:

Jukebox.play()

Grading Criteria
Your JavaScript Jukebox must:

1. Display at least one song on the page when the page loads
